        <h1>Guidance Notes  on the completion of the Self-Assessment Capability Survey Form</h1>
        <strong>Purpose</strong>
        <p>The purpose of the SACS form is to assist Member States and the IAEA to understand the current situation which exists in a State in relation to its preparedness for response to a nuclear security event and so, if required by the State, to initiate the process for improvement of national nuclear security response capability. This instrument is designed to consider, in detail, each key element of preparedness for response. By completing the SACS, the State should be able to identify the specific areas in nuclear security response capabilities in which its preparedness is strong, as well as identifying areas for improvement, which need to be addressed. Once all these areas for improvement have been identified, they can be prioritised by the State in an action plan (Capability Development Plan “CDP”),  nationally endorsed and, if required, jointly signed by the IAEA. Proper implementation of such an action plan will ensure that the State acquires its effective nuclear security event response capability, proportional to its expectations and needs. In addition, by following the SACS process it is hoped that Member States will be provided with a further opportunity to assimilate the recommendations of the IAEA with regard to the response to Nuclear Security Events. As soon as a State commences completion of the SACS process, the SACS forms and the CDP should be treated as confidential.</p>
        <strong>Structure of the SACS</strong>
        <p>Experience has demonstrated that a State’s response to nuclear security events (and indeed to all types of security events) is far more effective when that response follows a recognised structure. A generic response structure is set out in the IAEA Nuclear Security Series publications and in particular  in  Section 4 of NST 004 (Draft) in the form of key response activities. These activities include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information Gathering</li>
            <li>Information Analysis</li>
            <li>Notification, Activation and Deployment</li>
            <li>Interdiction</li>
            <li>Criminal Investigations</li>
            <li>Public Information</li>
            <li>Consequence Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The SACS follows this same structure, enabling a State to examine each Key Response Activity and Action of its response capabilities in detail. Additionally, the SACS refers to a number of overarching capabilities around National Response Plans and the issues of Command and Control which, although not a key activity per se, are essential if a State’s key activities are to be undertaken in a coordinated manner. </p>
